# Book_Tracking_System
This project is a terminal-based library management system developed as a team assignment in our second year of university.
The program allows users to store and manage information about the books they have read.


Project Overview


The Library Tracker provides a simple text-based interface where users can:



Features


  -Add new books
  
  -View all books
  
  -Edit existing book details
  
  -Delete books
  
  -Search for a book by its title
  
  -Save the library to a file (library2.txt)
  
  -Load data from the file when the program starts



 How It Works


  -The system stores each book using four fields inside a 2D character array.
  
  -File I/O is used to read/save data, so the user’s library persists between sessions.
  
  -Input validation is handled to prevent incorrect ratings or invalid choices.
  
  -Everything runs in the console (no graphical interface).



 Purpose of the Project

  
  -This project helped our team practice and understand:
  
  -Arrays and multi-dimensional data structures
  
  -String handling in C
  
  -File input/output (reading/writing text files)
  
  -Menu-driven program structure
  
  -Working collaboratively on structured C code
